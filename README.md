# Alzheimer-Prediction

The task of AD classification in this thesis is to distinguish individuals with normal cognition, individuals with mild cognitive impairment and AD patients. The 303 data used were all from ADNI (Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, https://adni.loni.usc.edu/)including structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI), age, sex, etc. The main exploration objective of this paper is sMRI. Firstly, a series of 3D image processing methods are used and three important interfaces are intercepted to synthesize three-channel color images. Then a modified 50 - layer residual neural network is constructed to extract the initial image features.

The extracted high-dimensional features are further analyzed, and the stacked denoising encoder is used to classify the features by support vector machine. Meanwhile, it is compared with principal component analysis and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding. Finally, according to various evaluation criteria, it was found that the SDAE-SVM model could effectively classify Alzheimer's disease with an accuracy of 98%, which was superior to other traditional models.
